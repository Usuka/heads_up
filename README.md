# Heads Up!
Just a short script I threw together to make updating your [Factorio](https://www,factorio.com)  headless server quick and easy.

This uses /opt/factorio at the default server installation directory, so just make sure to change that if that's not the case for you.

Must be run as root or with sudo

## Usage

EX: `$headsup.sh -x`

| Options 	| Update to...		| Format / msc.			|
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [-x] 		| latest experimental   |				|
| [-s]		| latest stable		|				|
| [-v] $VERSION | $VERSION		| #.##.## (inc. decimals)	|
| [-h]		| 			| display this info		|
